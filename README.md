# HCR using NEURAL NETWORKS



> The main aim of this project is to design expert system for “Handwritten Character Recognition(English) using Neural Network”. that can effectively recognize a particular character of type format using the Artificial Neural Network approach. Neural computer are trained (not Programmed) so that given a certain starting state (data input); they either classify the input data into one of the number of classes or cause the original data to evolve in such a way that a certain desirable property is optimized.

> The automatic recognition of handwritten text can be extremely useful in many applications where it is necessary to process large volumes of handwritten data, such as recognition of addresses and postcodes on envelopes, interpretation of amounts on bank checks, document analysis, and verification of signatures. Therefore, computer is needed to be able to read document or data for ease of document processing.
